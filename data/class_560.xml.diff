-<para>Note.  The traditional manner of naming esters has been to
-define the acid and alcohol moieties that are interracted. The basis
-for classifying esters in this class has been the acid moiety.In
-this reclassification, the use of the acid moiety as the primary
-basis for classification has been retained. However, whenever it
-was determined that no further subdivision of a body of patents
-could be established based upon variants of the acid moiety and
-consistent with good classification practice, further subdivision
-has been made on the characteristics of the alcohol moiety.  To
-avoid any confusion, the schedule of subclass titles specifically points
-out that a particular characteristic pertains to the acid moiety
-or the alcohol moiety. This factor, combined with the complexity
-of the compounds which involve pluralities of acid and alcohol moieties,
-has made it essential to establish a set of rules to determine which acid
-moiety and which alcohol moiety is to control the classification.</para>

-<para>II. Polycarboxylic Acid Esters</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>The treatment of polycarboxylic acid esters has not changed
-in this reclassification. However, since it presents potential pitfalls
-for classification and search, the problems are summarized here.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>Esters of polycarboxylic acids where one or more of the carboxyl
-groups are unesterified are classified with the polycarboxylic acid
-esters where all carboxyl groups may be in the free acid form or may
-be present as salts or as acid halides.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>When the unesterified carboxyl is reacted with an amine to
-form an amide, the compound is classified in the appropriate subclass
-of the group of esters containing nitrogen.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>Since an acid halide group on an acid moiety which contains
-an esterified carboxyl is the function which makes it a polycarboxylic
-acid ester, such compound is not considered to be halogenated, for
-classification purposes.  However, when the acid halide group is on
-an acid moiety which serves as the alcohol portion of an ester of
-an acid with higher priority, this restriction no longer applies
-and it may be considered as a halogenated alcohol.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>An anhydride of a half ester of a dicarboxylic acid with a
-monocarboxylic acid is regarded for classification purposes, as a
-monocarboxylic acid ester, e.g., BO(O&equals;C)AC(&equals;O)O(O&equals;)CD
-and the final classification will be determined by the functional
-groups present on both A and D which form the entire acid moiety.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>An anhydride of a half ester of a dicarboxylic acid with another
-dicarboxylic acid or half ester will be considered as a polycarboxylic
-acid, e.g., BO(O&equals;)CAC(&equals;O)O(O&equals;)CDC(&equals;O)OH.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>Here too, the final classification will be determined by the
-functional groups present on both A and D which form the entire
-acid moiety.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>III. Phenolic Esters</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>The only exception to the rules set forth in I. above, is
-that of phenolic esters of acyclic carboxylic acids.  Here, the
-primary basis of classification is the phenolic moitety, with the
-acids providing a secondary basis when all classifiable characteristics
-of the phenolic moiety have been exhausted.  As a further exception
-to this case, carbamic acid esters of phenols have been made special and
-appear before all other categories.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>IV. Salts</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>As a general rule, a salt forming moiety will not be considered
-as significant for classifying a carboxylic acid ester, unless it
-is, per se, an ester classifiable in this area, in which case its
-acid group will compete for priority with the acid group of the
-ester to which it is ionically bound. In this case, classification
-will be based solely on that ionic moiety which is superior.</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>B. Processes</para></note2>
-<note2>
-<para>The rules of classification with respect to processes follow
-the general rules as set forth in the class definition.  Since processes
-may appear in three different positions within the schedule, this
-rule is amplified to cover the three situations.</para></note2>
