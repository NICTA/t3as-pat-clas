# Fancytree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mar10/fancytree.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mar10/fancytree)

Fancytree is a JavaScript dynamic tree view plugin for jQuery with support for 
persistence, keyboard, checkboxes, tables, drag'n'drop, and lazy loading.

Fancytree 2.x is the designated successor of [DynaTree 1.x](https://code.google.com/p/dynatree/).


## Status

Concerning performance and functionality I would classify this project *Beta*.

However, one main motivation of this rewrite was a more consistent and intuitive 
API, so this is also a Call for comments: [let me know], if you have proposals 
for improvements on the API or architecture.  
This implies, that the API is not finalized yet: events, functions, and parameters
are still subject to change.  

You may vote for or [request new features](https://trello.com/c/qivETP2H) 
on the experimental [Scrumboard](https://trello.com/b/0eSYdyQv).

See the [change log](https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) 
for details (including **changes that break backwards compatibility**).
