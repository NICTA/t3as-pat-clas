  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Changed extension syntax
  * [FEATURE] Edit extension


# 2.0.0-2

  * **2013-08-31** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `onCustomRender` to `renderTitle`.  
    `renderTitle`, `renderNode` and `createNode` events are only triggered as options callback (not DOM events), for performance reasons.
  * **2013-08-25** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `data.orgEvent` to `data.originalEvent`
  * **2013-08-17** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed events to camelCase as suggested by the jQuery style guide (`rendernnode` -> `renderNode`, ...)
